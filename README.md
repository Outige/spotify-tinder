# getting started
I read the spotify [quickstart](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/). Here I learned to setup my dev account. This resource also told me that I have to register my app. All I did was go to my [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and click "create new app" and it seemed to do the trick. The app might not be [registered](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/).

The tutorial is using a tech stack I'm not familiar with so I decided to follow a [medium article](https://medium.com/@maxtingle/getting-started-with-spotifys-api-spotipy-197c3dc6353b) that's in python. I have a local link to the [screenshot](resources/spotipy.png) of the article.

You can mess around with the [spotify api console](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) to test the api end points.
